Did all the needed work (new tires, brakes, fuel pump, battery, coolant service) and also other preventative service as well. I only put on 10,000 miles in 5 years.\n\nHave all service receipts since 2020. It started every time and never left me stranded. Rides like it's on rails.\nIt does have an O2 sensor Service Engine Light on ... it comes and goes ... doesn't affect performance.\nInspection good until 11/25.\n\nIt is a 21 year old car so there are some minor dings on body. Interior is excellent and everything works.\nIt has Premium, Sport and Cold Weather package ... check the window sticker in photos.\n\nAll original books and 2 original keys.\n\nPlease no low balling ... will need to have a quick chat on phone before showing it. \nThanks for looking!",

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery\u00a0without a checkbook or credit card.\u00a0While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes.\u00a0We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually\u00a0won't\u00a0prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles,\u00a0including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.\u00a0 \u00a0 http://atmxi.com/inventory/5352Description:* Comfort Pack  * 20-Way Heated & Cooled Electric Front Seats  * Heated Powered Intelligent 3rd Row Seat Pack  * Oyster/Ebony/Oyster; Windsor Leather Seat Trim  * Radio: Meridian Surround Sound System  * Premium Interior Protection & Storage Pack  * Tow Hitch Receiver  * Panoramic Roof  * 60:40 Heated Electric Folding Rear Seats  * Leather Seats  * Navigation System  * 3rd Row Seat  * Full Length Black Roof Rails  * Wheel Protection Pack  * Basic Rear Seat Convenience Pack W/Integrated Base  * Emergency Pack  * Lane Keeping Assist  * Keyless Start  * Rear Spoiler  * Cooled Front Seat(S)  * Fuji White** CLEAN CARFAX OWNER** AUTONATION IS A HAGGLE FREE / ONE PRICE DEALERSHIP * WE OFFER OUR BEST PRICE UP FRONT TO ELIMINATE THE STRESS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH PURCHASING AT A DEALERSHIP * WE WOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU BUY A CAR * NOT JUST SELL YOU ONE * OFFERED WITH AN INDUSTRY LEADING AUTONATION 125 POINT INSPECTION AND A 90 DAY / 4,000 MILE WARRANTY * CALL NOW TO SCHEDULE YOUR TEST DRIVE * AN APPOINTMENT WILL GUARANTEE THE BEST USE OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME AND ENSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE SERVICE.Subject to prior sale.

Explore the roads with confidence in this well-preserved gem, boasting premium features that enhance every journey. From its luxurious interior to its powerful performance on the road, this Explorer is a testament to both style and substance. Seize the chance to own this remarkable 2014 Ford Explorer from a private seller who has cherished it, and make every drive an unforgettable experience.\nThis car boasts heated and ac leather seats (in perfect condition), push start ignition, backup camera, lane assist, parallel park assist, towing, auto windshield wipers (turns on by itself, and automatically adjusts frequency), four wheel drive, ambient lighting adjustable to different colors, premium sound system among many other features. (sticker price on this vehicle was over $49,000!!)\ngreat mechanical condition with quite smooth like new drive. No leaks. The sunroof shade works but not actual glass, probably needs new motor (which I have for buyer) and installation is easy. according to YouTube video is about 1 hour. Someone a little handy can do it himself\nI bought this car a couple of months ago and am impressed with everything about it, (as I\u2019m sure you will also). The only reason why I\u2019m selling it is because the size doesn\u2019t do well for my current needs.",

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery\u00a0without a checkbook or credit card.\u00a0While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes.\u00a0We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually\u00a0won't\u00a0prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles,\u00a0including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.\u00a0 \u00a0 http://atmxi.com/inventory/5069Description:* Premium Package 2  * Live Cockpit Pro W/Navi  * San Remo Green Metallic  * Sun/Moonroof  * Heated Front Seats  * Navigation System  * Remote Engine Start  * Heated Steering Wheel  * Keyless Start  * Cognac; Perforated Sensatec Upholstery  * Open Pore Fine Wood Oak Grain Trim  * Wheels: 18\" X 7.5\" V-Spoke Bi-Color Orbit GreyThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.
